# Site224 - An open source locations directory app for Guinea, Conakry

## About the project

This open source project is being created to demonstrate my full-stack programming skills, and usage of different technology stacks. The project involves creating a locations directory for the country Guinea, using data from Open Street Maps, to be consumed by the end-user via a webapp with pleasant UI interface. 

* _Languages being utilised:_ Python, Java, & JavaScript
* _Frameworks being utilised:_ Spring Boot, React/Next.Js, & Tailwind
* _Other Tools to use:_ MySQL (SQL), & Docker

### Breakdown
The project is comprised of 3 parts:

1. The first part is **Data Engineering**, and constitutes building a locally ran data pipeline using python. The built solution takes in OpenStreetMap data extracts as Inputs and outputs a .CSV file of cleaned/refined data that can be loaded into any database. Over 2 million records will be processed at this stage.
2. The second part is **Full-stack web development**, and involves build of a web-app to consume the data generated in part 1. The back-end/API of the web-app will be built using Java (Spring Boot), while the front-end will be built using React/NextJs. This particular choice of stack is due to its ubiquity across organisations today.
3. The third part is **DevOps**. This involves building a dockerized file to facilitate deployment of the WebApp built in Step 2, to cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP or Azure.




### Timeline
- Entire project to be built in a couple of evenings over the span of a week. :)
